1. A method that returns the sum of two integers
Casual psuedo-code:

Given num1 and num2 as parameters.

Add num1 and num2 to get sum.

Formal psuedo-code:

START

# Given num1 and num2 as parameters to method.

SET sum = num1 + num2

END

2. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
Casual psuedo-code:

Given array of strings.

Iterate through array, one string at a time
  - save first string into new string
  - add second string and so on until end of array
  
After iteration, return new string.

Formal psuedo-code:

START

# Given an array of strings called string_array.

WHILE string_array is not empty
  SET new_string = new_string + value of array at space 0
  reduce string_array by value of array at 0
  
PRINT new_string

END

3. A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. Example: everyOther([1, 4, 7, 2, 5]) => [1,7,5]

Casual psuedo-code:
Given array of integers.

Iterate over array of integers.
  - Add first element to new array
  - Skip second element
  - Continue until all elements have been iterated through.

Return new array.

Formal psuedo-code:
START

# Given an array of integers called numbers.

SET iterator = 0
SET new_numbers = []

WHILE iterator <= length of numbers
  Add numbers[iterator] to new_numbers
  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT new_numbers

END  

4. A method that determines the index of the 3rd occurence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil

Casual psuedo-code:

Given string.
Given character.

Iterate over every character in string.
  Increase count for character occurence.
  When character occurence is 3.
    Show index of occurence.
  At end, if character occurence is less than 3.
    Show nil.
  
Formal psuedo-code:

# Given character called character and string called string.

SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator <= 3




5. A method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elemenets at the odd indexes. For instance: merge);1, 2, 3,], [4, 5, 6]} => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6].
