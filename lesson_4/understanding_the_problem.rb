# The PEDAC Process

## P: Understanding the Problem

#   - Establish the rules/define the boundaries of the problem
#       - Assessing available informaiton
#       - Restating explicit requirements
#       - Identify Implicit requirements
#   - Spend enough time. Don't rush this step.


#   - Explicit - those that are clearly stated in the problem discription
#   - Implicit - not stated but can be extrapolated from understanding of the problem
#   General Example

# Given a string, produce a new string with every other word removed
#   - Explicit requirements:
#     - Input: String
#     - Output: new string
#     - Remove every other word form input string

#   - Questions:
#   - What do we mean by every other word?
#   - How do we define a word in this context?
